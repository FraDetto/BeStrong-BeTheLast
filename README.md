# Be strong, be the last
The player is a car driver, and he has to compete on fantastic circuits with only one goal: to finish last!

## Introduction
As said the game has a simple goal: to arrive last in a car race.
But being so is not so simple: the car accelerates by itself, the player can only make it steer or drift (but for a few seconds. It also has a small recharge time, so you have to use it well to make the curves right).
If you crash into the edges of the track, they send you back to the circuit and they accelerate your run. If you try to go backwards: your machine is straightened out and accelerated.
To slow down (and try to be the last), the player must: crash into different obstacles that appear on the track or collide with the other players.
For collisions with other players let us consider the car divided into two parts: the front part and the back part. When your front side collides with the back part of another car you are slowed down while your opponent accelerates.
If, on the other hand, the collision occurs between back-to-back or front-to-front then both cars are slowed slightly.
For the track there are also various consumable objects that can slow down your run or accelerate the run of your opponents. The effect depends on your position in the partial ranking.
Others will be obtained as prizes for mini goals achieved during the race.
In the game you can play against AI or against friends in a local multiplayer.
